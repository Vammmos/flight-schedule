# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Scheduling System

## üìå Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction

Flight Scheduling System is a mini web-based project designed to simulate the core functionality of flight scheduling in the aviation sector. Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP**, and a **MySQL backend**, it allows users to schedule flights by selecting aircraft and entering departure and destination details along with date and time.

There are two main modules:
- A scheduling form with validation
- A detailed aircraft info page

JavaScript handles validation, PHP processes the form and stores the data. A confirmation page appears after successful scheduling.

This project is an educational tool to demonstrate full-stack web development, from frontend to backend, simulating a real-world scheduling system.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Create a simple and efficient aircraft scheduling system.
- Enable users to schedule flights online.
- Validate and process data securely.
- Store flight info in a database.
- Design an intuitive user interface.

### 1.3 Purpose
To replace manual scheduling or verbal instructions with a web interface for efficient flight planning and aircraft information display.

### 1.4 Project Scope
- Users can view available aircraft details.
- Users can schedule flights via a form.
- Data is securely stored in a database.
- A confirmation page verifies scheduling.
- Focus on scheduling and displaying aircraft info.

### 1.5 Applicability
- Flight schools and aviation academies
- Small-scale aviation services
- Educational institutions teaching full-stack web development
